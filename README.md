## â„¹ About

>[Moonlight PC](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source PC client for NVIDIA GameStream and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).

>Moonlight also has mobile versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).

>You can follow development on our [Discord server](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord) and help translate Moonlight into your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-qt/).

This project fixes connection timeouts when connecting via Moonlight to a machine with GPU-Paravirtualization enabled. This is the only change in comparison to the original project.
